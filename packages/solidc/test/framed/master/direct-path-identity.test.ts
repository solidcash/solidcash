/**
 * The `direct` convention is the shipped one, and the framed work must not fork it. Every case compiles once
 * with the option omitted and once with `composition: 'direct'`, and those two artifacts must be the same bytecode.
 * The hashes are that bytecode. They moved once when an integer literal beside a bounded operand took its type, so
 * `x + 1` carries the range check Solidity gives it, and again after later direct-convention fixes: a signature
 * check stays at the front of the entry the SDK signs, and `msg.sender` is read from the authenticated execution
 * frame, and once more when the record and container covenants were bound to the contract's own lock. A framed
 * compile may add artifacts, but it may not make these two directs disagree.
